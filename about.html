      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>Vee is a pistachio green TV with a black screen. She has two black antennas topped with grey spheres, with her right antenna being bent in a sort of zigzag line while the other is straight. Her facial features are lime green with a confident smirk on her face. Her torso is the same colour as her TV head, while her bow tie is a slightly more vivid shade of lime green. Her limbs are grey and, as seen in some artworks and her idle animations, she is revealed to have a retractable tail with a microphone topper. The microphone has a dark green handle with a grey grill. During Blackouts, she gives off a green glow. When hit by a twisted, a blue error screen appears on her, which her glow and attacked face changes depending on what skin she's wearing.</p>

          <h2>Personality</h2>
          <p>Vee is a straightforward Toon who sometimes acts arrogant and shows off her superiority, as seen in some of her dialogues and interactions. She subtly shows some dislike towards  Dandy in some of her dialogues. Itâ€™s shown that she is logical and wants the other Toons to better themselves, though she may be very blunt about it. She also seems to not express much emotion other than being unamused for the most part, yet showing confidence. She has trouble complimenting others without coming off as backhanded, as shown in one of her interactions with  Brightney. She also seems to tend to have a dismissive nature when she interacts with most Toons. Despite acting arrogant, she shows a soft spot for  Astro, being even a bit protective towards him, as seen in her interactions with Astro and  Rodger.

            Though Vee comes off as straightforward and blunt, she hints that she cares for the other Toons and wants the best for them. It's also implied that her rudeness is unintentional.

          <h2>Strategies</h2>
          <p>Although Toons with 5 Skill Check like  Shelly or  Gigi may actually out-speed her if lucky, Vee is the Toon with the best extraction potential in the game, having 4 Star Skill Check and 5 Star Extraction Speed. However, those powered stats come at the cost of being one of the worst at escaping Twisteds as she possesses below-average Stealth and below-average mobility.  Glisten can fill in for Vee as a safer alternative, as Glisten's 5 Star Extraction Speed will also make him a viable option if you're looking to play Survivalist/Extractor rather than Supporter/Extractor and can handle Glisten's 2 Star Skill Check in comparison to Vee's 4 Stars. You can choose  Yatta for an exclusive alternative, as Yatta's 3 Star Skill Check would be better than an Extractor with only 2 Stars in Skill Check and excellent at your playstyle with her high movement speed because she would be the second-runner (placed with 4 Stars on Movement Speed) extraction Toon (after  Dandy).  Brightney also plays similarly to Vee, sharing many strengths like Extraction and Ability, but possessing above-average mobility. </p>

          <p>It is recommended to use  Mic Check to plan out the safest route to Machines highlighted by Camera Hijack. Even then, Mic Check's cooldown will make this unreliable, although it does grant other Toons helpful information in the process.</p>
            
          <p>Vee is best used on a team or when there are other players working to distract the Twisteds. Her extremely high Extraction Speed allows the group to complete floors much more quickly, provided she's alive to make use of it. Supports like  Goob and  Astro can greatly increase her survival time through distracting or helping her out of danger. Vee can use Mic Check to help her teammates in return, granting valuable information.
            
          <p>Mic Check is best used at the beginning of a Floor to alert your team to Twisted locations and types, but has other benefits. Here are some tips for using it:
            
          <p>Be aware that on lower graphics settings, players may not be able to see highlighted Twisteds that are far away, or they may simply not be paying attention. So, it's good to make it your responsibility to call them out to teammates if  Twisted Razzle & Dazzle, Ranged Twisteds such as  Twisted Goob and  Twisted Scraps, Main Twisteds, or even new Twisteds (as teammates may want research) are present. Twisted Vee will immediately add pop-ups to all players' screens, so she's self-evident while Shelly's effects and Mains' sound effects can be easier to miss. Take note of the number of Twisteds- if one seems to be missing, it's very possible  Twisted Rodger is present; he should be called out as well. In R&D and Rodger's cases, even if you don't feel threatened by them, simply knowing they're present helps the Distractor know that there's one less Twisted to collect, and for teammates to be cautious of their paths or what capsules they pick up.
          <p> Using Mic Check well can be tricky. Use it when in dead ends/other situations where your survivability is greatly boosted by knowing who's near. It can be used to alert teammates to the fact that you're/another teammate is being chased or that Twisteds are drawing near them or the Elevator during Panic Mode. Use Mic Check if you notice your Distractor hasn't gotten all of the Twisteds yet (if they can handle all of them) or if someone is struggling to get encounter research. It has many applications, but remember that using it at the beginning of Floors is your second priority, the first being getting to the next Floor in the first place. Try to save it, but don't sweat it if your usage saves someone's HP.
          <p>Camera Hijack also has a variety of strategies despite being simpler:
            
          <p>As it highlights the nearest uncompleted Machine in white if another player is currently extracting it and in green if not, it can be used to tell if other players should GTE (Get To Elevator). The highlight also shows how much completion is on said Machine, so Vees can additionally easily GTE early and let Distractors know slightly ahead of time when Panic Mode is about to start. They can let players know if the last Machine is at the Elevator as well.
            Since Camera Hijack shows Machines through walls, a good understanding of Machine locations and map layouts helps Vee players take full advantage of the ability.
            It prevents teams with her on them from spending excessive amounts of time hunting for the last Machine (it will always be highlighted), which is a nice bonus. On large Floors, this is a great help.
            Do not immediately run for the closest Machine- your Stealth and Movement Speed will get you hurt and you will lose focus on hunting Items that Vee requires. If you don't know the map well, you might also reach a dead end. Don't compete with teammates to reach it- you're simply wasting valuable Stamina. Do recognize that if the highlighted Machine is very far away, that indicates there are no closer Machines. Mentally note this so you know which rooms to enter and which are a larger waste of time- direct teammates in the right direction if this occurs with many Machines remaining.
            Completed Machines  Twisted Connie is possessing are not highlighted by Camera Hijack. This information helps Vee avoid taking damage from her and chasing red lights for no reason.
            A general survival tip for Vee is, before extracting a machine, take note of nearby islands/escape routes, then extract. If a Twisted appears and sees you, immediately use the route and lose interest. This tip may seem like common sense, but many players do not implement the basics and Vee desperately requires them.</p>
